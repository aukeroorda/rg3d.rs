Now it's the time to fix that! For last three months rg3d and rusty-editor has gained
lots and lots of big features and improvements. Also I started making new game using the engine - a
Sci-Fi 3D shooter called Station Iapetus, check the end of the post for more info, but for now just
check the video:</p> <div class="row"><div class="col col-12 text-center"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/tENty9W1_NA" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></div></div> <h2 id="rg3d"><a href="#rg3d" class="header-anchor">#</a> rg3d</h2> <p>Lets start from the engine, it has 139 new commits from November 2020, here are the most interesting
changes (prepare for the wall of text ðŸ˜ƒ ):</p> <ul><li>Improved dark UI theme - <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mrDIMAS/rusty-editor/master/screenshots/latest.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">default dark theme is more elegant now<span><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-hidden="true" focusable="false" x="0px" y="0px" viewBox="0 0 100 100" width="15" height="15" class="icon outbound"><path fill="currentColor" d="M18.8,85.1h56l0,0c2.2,0,4-1.8,4-4v-32h-8v28h-48v-48h28v-8h-32l0,0c-2.2,0-4,1.8-4,4v56C14.8,83.3,16.6,85.1,18.8,85.1z"></path> <polygon fill="currentColor" points="45.7,48.7 51.3,54.3 77.2,28.5 77.2,37.2 85.2,37.2 85.2,14.9 62.8,14.9 62.8,22.9 71.5,22.9"></polygon></svg> <span class="sr-only">(opens new window)</span></span></a>.</li> <li>Added verbosity levels for logger - now you can reduce &quot;noise&quot; levels from the engine by setting
verbosity for the logger.</li> <li>Improved lightmap quality - lightmaps are now smoothed and almost seam-free.</li> <li>Added proper syncing between physics and scene graph - which means that it is possible now to
add a static physical body to a node and every descendant node will provide its geometry as collider
for the body.</li> <li>Improved examples - added navigational mesh example which demonstrates how to use
navigation agents.</li> <li>Improved particle systems - added cylinder emitter for particle systems, improved performance.</li> <li>TextBox widget now have multiline mode and different &quot;commit&quot; modes (LostFocus, Enter, etc).</li> <li>Improved lots of UI widgets and added VectorImage widget.</li> <li>rg3d-sound is now able to manage multiple contexts - which means that you can easily create multiple
sound scenes and operate on them separately! This is extremely useful for multi-scene games: for example
you can now create a sound scene for a menu and one for game level and all entities on the sound scenes
will be completely decoupled from each other.</li> <li><a href="https://github.com/mrDIMAS/hrtf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">hrtf<span><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-hidden="true" focusable="false" x="0px" y="0px" viewBox="0 0 100 100" width="15" height="15" class="icon outbound"><path fill="currentColor" d="M18.8,85.1h56l0,0c2.2,0,4-1.8,4-4v-32h-8v28h-48v-48h28v-8h-32l0,0c-2.2,0-4,1.8-4,4v56C14.8,83.3,16.6,85.1,18.8,85.1z"></path> <polygon fill="currentColor" points="45.7,48.7 51.3,54.3 77.2,28.5 77.2,37.2 85.2,37.2 85.2,14.9 62.8,14.9 62.8,22.9 71.5,22.9"></polygon></svg> <span class="sr-only">(opens new window)</span></span></a> crate now has 2 times better performance - thanks for
performance improvements in rustfft crate.</li> <li>Added support for 64-bit FBX format (version 7500+) - it is very important because mixamo.com migrated
to latest FBX SDK and all of the animations and character models have become &quot;unloadable&quot; - now it is fixed.</li> <li>Animation blending state machines were improved - I added BlendAnimationsByIndex state machine node which
allows you to switch animations by index with given amount of time for transition.</li> <li>It's now possible to copy nodes in-place - previously it was possible only to copy node from scene
to scene.</li> <li>The number of draw calls for UI was reduced by 70% - I changed the way of how clipping works: previously
it was using stencil buffer, now it uses scissor test.</li> <li>Fixed UI clipping issues - this is related to previous point - it seems that using stencil test wasn't a
good idea.</li> <li>Fixed text measurement in the UI - previously text's height was measured incorrectly.</li> <li>Opacity for UI widgets was added - this extensively used to greyout disabled widgets.</li> <li>Layout of Scroll- and Wrap- panels was fixed.</li> <li>Light scatter issues for spot lights were fixed - due to incorrect trigonometry calculations light
volumes were clipped.</li> <li>Support for transparent meshes - simple forward renderer was added to render transparent meshes.</li> <li>Migrated to rapier 0.5 - which fixed lots of issues in the physics.</li> <li>Animation signal handling is fixed when animation playing in reverse.</li> <li>Animation tracks now are able to filter position/scale/rotation.</li> <li>Sprite rendering fixes - there was incorrect blending options that were causing graphical issues.</li> <li><a href="https://github.com/FyroxEngine/Fyrox/blob/master/rg3d-core/src/pool.rs" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Pool<span><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-hidden="true" focusable="false" x="0px" y="0px" viewBox="0 0 100 100" width="15" height="15" class="icon outbound"><path fill="currentColor" d="M18.8,85.1h56l0,0c2.2,0,4-1.8,4-4v-32h-8v28h-48v-48h28v-8h-32l0,0c-2.2,0-4,1.8-4,4v56C14.8,83.3,16.6,85.1,18.8,85.1z"></path> <polygon fill="currentColor" points="45.7,48.7 51.3,54.3 77.2,28.5 77.2,37.2 85.2,37.2 85.2,14.9 62.8,14.9 62.8,22.9 71.5,22.9"></polygon></svg> <span class="sr-only">(opens new window)</span></span></a> now implements FromIterator
trait.</li> <li>Navigation meshes are now correctly copied when instantiating model resource, however inheritance is
not yet implemented.</li> <li>Fixed polygon triangulation - there was an incorrect loop exit condition.</li> <li>Now FBX loader does not add redundant &quot;root&quot; node in the scene during instantiation.</li> <li>Fixed layout issues in FileBrowser and FileSelector widgets.</li> <li>Now it is possible to render instances of UserInterface in separate render targets - this is extremely
useful when you need to draw offscreen UI (for example a touch screen panel in a sci-fi game).</li> <li>Added Fast Approximate AntiAliasing (FXAA) - not the best solution for anti-aliasing, but very cheap
and easy to implement.</li> <li>Fixed lots of Clippy warnings.</li> <li>Added integrity checks for resource instances - now engine automatically adds missing nodes from resource
if an instance of the resource does not have it.</li> <li>Improved resource inheritance - now the engine is able to correctly resolve dependencies of resources.</li> <li>Scene nodes now have tags - very useful feature to mark nodes with game info. For example, lights can be
marked with &quot;FlashingLight&quot; tag and later on you can search all the lights with such tag and add &quot;flashing&quot;
behaviour.</li> <li>Now scene graph allows to perform custom search using custom predicate.</li> <li>Slightly improved user interface performance.</li> <li>Improved performance of animation machine's <code>set_parameter</code> method.</li> <li>Now it is possible to select binding direction between a rigid body and a scene node - previously only
node-to-body binding was possible, but now body-to-node binding is available too.</li> <li>Lots of improvements in SceneDrawingContext - fixed drawing of shapes, added <code>draw_capsule</code> and
<code>draw_sphere_section</code>, <code>draw_segment_capsule</code> methods.</li> <li>Fixed calculation of isometric transform which was used in physics-to-graph transform syncing.</li> <li>Now scene gathers performance statistics per frame.</li> <li>Added ColorGradientBuilder which allows to build ColorGradient in declarative manner.</li> <li>Added navigation agents (commonly known as NavmeshAgent) which are used for navigation on arbitrary
navigation meshes.</li> <li>Added path smoothing for navmeshes - now behaviour of agents are much nicer, check the video below.</li></ul> <div class="row"><div class="col col-12 text-center"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/tqFdQ5OPB1I" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></div></div> <h2 id="rusty-editor"><a href="#rusty-editor" class="header-anchor">#</a> <a href="https://github.com/mrDIMAS/rusty-editor" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">rusty-editor<span><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-hidden="true" focusable="false" x="0px" y="0px" viewBox="0 0 100 100" width="15" height="15" class="icon outbound"><path fill="currentColor" d="M18.8,85.1h56l0,0c2.2,0,4-1.8,4-4v-32h-8v28h-48v-48h28v-8h-32l0,0c-2.2,0-4,1.8-4,4v56C14.8,83.3,16.6,85.1,18.8,85.1z"></path> <polygon fill="currentColor" points="45.7,48.7 51.3,54.3 77.2,28.5 77.2,37.2 85.2,37.2 85.2,14.9 62.8,14.9 62.8,22.9 71.5,22.9"></polygon></svg> <span class="sr-only">(opens new window)</span></span></a></h2> <p><img src="/assets/rusty_editor_27_02_21_00.jpg" alt="Screenshot1"></p> <p>rusty-editor changes rapidly too, it has 96 new commits from November 2020, here are the most interesting
changes:</p> <ul><li>Added an editor for navigation meshes - there is still no automatic generation for navmeshes, so I added
simple navmesh editor.</li> <li>Added an editor for particle systems - currently is not so flexible, but powerful enough for some
not too complex effects.</li> <li>Improved copy/paste in rusty-editor - now it correctly copies all associated entities (rigid bodies,
colliders, etc)</li> <li>Configurator now remembers history of previously selected working directories, which is very useful for
quick iterations.</li> <li>Now gizmos have shadows disabled.</li> <li>Interaction modes now behaves <em>almost</em> correctly.</li> <li>Added debug drawing of the physics - this allows a user to precisely configure location of colliders and rigid
bodies.</li> <li>Now it is possible to edit properties of colliders.</li> <li>Fixed deletion of complex selection - this means that editor won't panic or behave unexpectedly when you
trying to delete multiple nodes at once.</li> <li>Added support for joints of various kinds.</li> <li>Disabled ability to delete root node.</li> <li>Added ability to create directional lights.</li> <li>Added scene validation before saving.</li> <li>Some menu items are now disabled when there is no active scene.</li> <li>Asset previewer now has grid which allows you to quickly understand the size of a model.</li> <li>Now editor prints current scene's path.</li> <li>Added &quot;breadcrumbs&quot; - it shows a path from selected node to scene root, it is very useful for quick navigation.</li> <li>Limited camera pitch - now it is impossible to be upside-down.</li> <li>Added switch for binding direction for rigid bodies.</li> <li>Added &quot;Is Sensor&quot; flag for rigid bodies.</li> <li>Disabled editing node names of resource instances - this is related to resource inheritance, it relies on the
suggestion that name won't change after instantiation.</li> <li>Track instantiated animations - previously editor just &quot;forget&quot; about instantiated animations which was leading
to orphaned animations.</li> <li>Added ability to edit tags.</li></ul> <h2 id="stationiapetus"><a href="#stationiapetus" class="header-anchor">#</a> <a href="https://github.com/mrDIMAS/StationIapetus" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">StationIapetus<span><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-hidden="true" focusable="false" x="0px" y="0px" viewBox="0 0 100 100" width="15" height="15" class="icon outbound"><path fill="currentColor" d="M18.8,85.1h56l0,0c2.2,0,4-1.8,4-4v-32h-8v28h-48v-48h28v-8h-32l0,0c-2.2,0-4,1.8-4,4v56C14.8,83.3,16.6,85.1,18.8,85.1z"></path> <polygon fill="currentColor" points="45.7,48.7 51.3,54.3 77.2,28.5 77.2,37.2 85.2,37.2 85.2,14.9 62.8,14.9 62.8,22.9 71.5,22.9"></polygon></svg> <span class="sr-only">(opens new window)</span></span></a></h2> <p>As I mentioned in the beginning of the post, I started making a new game.
